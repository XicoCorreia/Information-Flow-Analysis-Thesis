1. If index is high, should store be high, what if for load? Both 
  R: Both should by High (Good idea to redo the information flow challenge SOS)
  declare array x : low ;
  x[h]=true; -> Shouldnt be allowed to used high idx
  l=x[true]; -> this is fine
  Using high as index reveals the secret
2. In the case a jump is inside a high context, for example jeq r3 == 6, do I make r3 high? 
  R: No but check it formally
3. Should I start with Inference rules/Type system or Interval Analysis?
  R: Inference Rules - How an instruction evolve and change the state of security level (Explain each) 
4. Go through Report and see where it should changed
  R: Everything :)

1. When loading a value to a register we can also decrease the security value like a mov op?
R: Correct

The big endian and little endian change the byte order, how could I handle it?
