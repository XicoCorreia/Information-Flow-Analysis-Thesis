1. If index is high, should store be high, what if for load? Both 
  R: Both should by High (Good idea to redo the information flow challenge SOS)
  declare array x : low ;
  x[h]=true; -> Shouldnt be allowed to used high idx
  l=x[true]; -> this is fine
  Using high as index reveals the secret
2. In the case a jump is inside a high context, for example jeq r3 == 6, do I make r3 high? 
  R: No but check it formally
3. Should I start with Inference rules/Type system or Interval Analysis?
  R: Inference Rules - How an instruction evolve and change the state of security level (Explain each) 
4. Go through Report and see where it should changed
  R: Everything :)
--------------------------
1. When loading a value to a register we can also decrease the security value like a mov op?
R: Correct
--------------------------
How to work with ifs in the analysis?
R: Update both the registers used. Diff = identity
UnaryExp: The big endian and little endian change the byte order, how could I handle it?
R: Identity
--------------------------
Should I normalize the intervals before every operation?
R:
Case for the division, what if the element can be 0?
R: 
Take a look at or/and, are the intervals correct?
R:
What about XOR, I cant find any ideas of how to do it?
R:
Mod, show https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31057473/calculating-the-modulo-of-two-intervals.
R: 
Is the policy kv is basically the exp judgment?
R:
A program being typable? refers to a program that can be assigned a valid type according to a given type system.
A typable program is one that satisfies the security type rules ensuring that it does not violate information flow policies.
R:
Attacker model?
